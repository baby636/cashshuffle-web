      <h2>- FAQ -</h2>
      <p><strong>What is Bitcoin Cash?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer electronic cash, based on the Bitcoin protocol. <a href="https://bitcoincash.org" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is the difference between coin mixing and cash shuffle?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>&quot;Coin mixing&quot; commonly refers to the use of services that allow a user to replace his or her coins with a
          different set of coins.</p>
        <p>Cash shuffle is different. It allows users to combine their transactions with others, creating obfuscation.</p>
        <p>The disadvantages of coin mixing is that the user must trust the mixing service, and usually has to pay a fee. But
          with Cash Shuffle, there is no risk of lost funds, and no additional fees.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What coordinates the shuffle between users?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Cash Shuffle uses a client-server model. The servers coordinate which users are shuffling.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Are you running a shuffling service? Are you running one of these servers?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>No. We simply publish code. It is up to the community to run servers.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>In practical terms then, how do I use this? How does the network get bootstrapped?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>As servers come online, they can request inclusion to the client side seed server list via GitHub.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is the client side software?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Our client side implementation is a plugin to the popular Electron Cash wallet. Instructions for running it are <a href="https://github.com/cashshuffle/cashshuffle-electron-cash-plugin" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>But this is just one implementation. CashShuffle could be implemented in other front end tools and wallets by following
          the documented protocol.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is the server side software?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The server side software is written in Golang and available on
          <a href="https://github.com/cashshuffle/cashshuffle" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is &quot;CoinJoin&quot;?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>CoinJoin is the simple, but effective idea of combining inputs and outputs from what would otherwise be separate transactions,
          into one jumbo transaction. This makes it extremely difficult to know which outputs correspond to which inputs.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is &quot;CoinShuffle&quot;?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Coin Shuffle is a protocol which implements CoinJoin in a practical way. A layered encryption scheme is used so that
          none of the participants know the outputs of the other participants. In addition, a blame protocol is used to mitigate
          time-wasting denial-of-service type attacks.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What is the difference between CoinShuffle and CashShuffle?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>CoinShuffle is an excellent protocol once the participants for a joined transaction have already been chosen. However,
          it provides no means for establishing such groupings. CashShuffle builds upon CoinShuffle and adds a matching service.
          As such, it is a more complete and usable protocol.</p>
        <p>The server, like the individual participants, also has no knowledge of which input corresponds to which output.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Can this be used for illegal purposes?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We do not advocate, condone, or promote the use of this technology for illegal purposes. It is intended for legal privacy
          use only.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>What are the use-cases for CashShuffle?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>CashShuffle is intended for confidential business purchases, personal privacy, and increasing overall coin fungibility.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Can the server(s) steal money?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The server cannot steal money in a proper CashShuffle implementation because the transactions are only signed on the
          client side if they are valid.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Should users set up as many servers as possible so its more decentralized?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>No. In the beginning, fewer, but more reliable servers are ideal. Too many servers means users will be thinly spread
          and will have a harder time finding join partners.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Will the software be improved in the future? Is there a roadmap?</strong></p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We are constantly working, building, and researching. Our goal is to bring fully decentralized, frictionless, and peer-to-peer
          privacy and fungibility solutions to Bitcoin Cash.</p>
